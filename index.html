            <h4 id="about-me-sections">My Initial Beginnings</h4>
            <p id="about-me-desc">I am a 22 year old Applied Mathematics Major, who just recently graduated from the 
                University of California Riverside in the Summer of 2020. 
                A majority of my college career, I spent most of my time studying, 
                participating in research, and growing my Mathematics knowledge by being an avid member of the UCR Mathematics Club.
                Apart from my endeavors in school, I found small interests in studying Python coding and gaining Google certificates for Ad Search.
                These small interests gradually increased as I was ending my college career.

            <h4 id="about-me-sections">What caused my change in Career Path?</h4>
            <p id="about-me-desc">Web Development became the newest venture of mine, since it is a growing industry and I have a shared interest in 
                learning the "behind the scenes" knowledge that allows computers to function. Initially, I started off with very 
                little knowledge of developing coherent code. This, along with my rapidly growing interests in Web Development
                and Programming, urged me to sign up for the Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp offered at the UCR Extension.

        <section class="messages">
            <h4 id="about-me-sections">What have I gained from this?</h4>
            <p id="about-me-desc">As of today I am religiously practicing HTML, CSS Styling, and Javascript (in terms of Web development).
                I also am proficient in Python, as I have gained a Code Academy certificate through about 6+ months worth of Python 
                practice and study within their program. Both programs also taught me how to establish a profile among Github, from which I 
                learned to understand the Git version control system. Now I use all of this knowledge to establish a stronger foundation
                in my journey in becoming a Full Full-Stack Web Developer/Programmer.
