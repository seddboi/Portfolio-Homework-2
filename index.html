                    <p>I am a 22 year old Applied Mathematics Major, who just recently graduated from the 
                        University of California Riverside in the Summer of 2020. 
                        A majority of my college career, I spent most of my time studying, 
                        participating in research, and growing my Mathematics knowledge by being an avid member of the UCR Mathematics Club.
                        Apart from my endeavors in school, I found small interests in studying Python coding and gaining Google certificates for Ad Search.</p>

                        little knowledge of developing coherent code. This, along with my rapidly growing interests in Web Development
                        and Programming, urged me to sign up for the Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp offered at the UCR Extension.</p>

                        I also am proficient in Python, as I have gained a Code Academy certificate through about 6+ months worth of Python 
                        practice and study within their program. Both programs also taught me how to establish a profile among Github, from which I 
                        learned to understand the Git version control system. Now I use all of this knowledge to establish a stronger foundation
                        in my journey in becoming a Full-Stack Web Developer/Programmer.r</p>
